Experiment Project Documentation
========================

Introduction
-----------------

This section captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

Project
-----------------

**Domain Name : **Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name : **Speech Signal processing** 

**Experiment Name : **Manual speech signal-to-symbol transformation

The objective of this lab is to provide hands on experience in processing speech signals for extraction of information for various applications.
Purpose of the project.In this we learned to process their own speech and listen to the processed speech to get a feel for effects of various signal processing operations on speech signals.


-----------------

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Manual speech ** to signal-to-symbol   from **Java** to **Javascript**.

Process Followed to convert the experiment

1.  Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2.  Understanding the experiment concept
3.  Re-implement the same in javascript

Value Added by our Project
-----------------

1.  It would be beneficial for engineering students
2.  Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of perception learning.

Risks and Challenges
-----------------

Using a new library like Wavesurfer.js and integrating it with Javascript was a bit challenging as it is very less support on stackoverflow. One of the biggest challenge was to make small segments of audio. It was a great experience using this library with javascript which helped to brush up my javascript concepts.

Experiment Procedure Documentation
